Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn''t take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.

Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us.

Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.

After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm ''Queensbury Rules'' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. ', 4, 5);

In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you''ve seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.

In the last month, the users have decreed "Airbender" the worst abomination ever, when in fact it''s just an average movie. User reviews raved over "Despicable Me", when it was about as entertaining as a "Dexter''s Lab" rerun. And now? "Inception" is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a very creative and interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. The problem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or a dream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they''re dreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooner or later you stop caring about the actual action because it''s a dream. So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the pouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up a ski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what''s-his-name float around a hotel just didn''t do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd greatest movie ever? You must be dreaming.', 6, 3);

A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan''s mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.  To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it''s storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn''t expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don''t worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay. ', 6, 4);

Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).   The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It''s great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.  Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you''re thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay.   Truly unique, like nothing i''ve ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn''t afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.', 6, 5);

Its bringing a real rating of a 4. But the train doesn''t come. This is not my dream. Omg. I''m going to wake up, and the real rating will be a 4, like reality. Reality as it should be, if movies were properly rated. But there''s an explosion. The movie is still rated a 9.4. If I jump, maybe out of a window and die in my dream, which is someone else''s dream, I might wake up to get the real rating of this movie, a 4. The van falls, I''m drowning. Finally after a long long long time, I wake up. Thank god it was all a dream. I check the rating at IMDb. OMG NO! I must still be in someone else''s dream.  As the big blockbuster movies become more awful, their rating consistently get higher. Any time I see a high rated (7+) new movie on a major rating website I become suspicious now. Too many times I''ve wasted money on crap movies because the rating said it was good. I guess they decided to push it to the limits of a 10 this time to really fool people like me that are becoming wary.  The movie deserves about a 4 out of 10. The 4 is given for the nice colors and pretty good graphics. However, the plot is weak, the characters are weak, its not thought provoking or intellectual. There''s no brilliant script or any new directional style here. And it feels longer than a run on sentence.  Long. Boring. Jumbled. Good concept and stars wasted on this movie. See it if you have to, but don''t spend money on it. Every time we spend money to see bad movies it sends a message that we are willing to accept less, and pay more. Your money is your real vote. Only vote for what is good.', 6, 3);

Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.  None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION. A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan''s endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film''s ensemble cast - DiCaprio''s performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it. With this and Shutter Island, now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception''s action sequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film''s unravelling, whilst we remain rooted to the film''s emotional stakes, which give immense purpose to the film''s complex and layered narrative.', 6, 4);
